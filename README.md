## Introduction

Gaining a deep understanding of data structures is crucial for writing efficient algorithms and building robust software applications. This repository, centered around Python, is a compilation of the knowledge I acquired during my master's studies. It aims to provide clear explanations, examples, and implementations of various data structures in the context of Python.

## List of Data Structures

1. [Classes & Pointers](#Classes&Pointers)
2. [Linked List](#LinkedList)
3. [Double Linked List](#DoubleLinkedList)
3. [Stack](#Stack)
4. [Queue](#Queue)
5. [Tree](#Tree)
7. [Hash Table](#HashTable)

Each data structure has its dedicated markdown file with explanations, examples, and sample code.
